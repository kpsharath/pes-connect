# PES Connect

We aim to present a website which will help students to stay updated and help him to organize things better. Using our website, 
he can contact a faculty for doubt clarification or post a query. The chat room features enables a student easy access to a faculty or 
his friends. He can also maintain all his notes of various subjects in the website. There is also an in-built Twitter like social 
network where in the students can post about the latest happenings in college. Hence by our website, we want to provide and ensure that 
all the important things that a student needs will be at his fingertips. 

We also have a todo list, which helps students to be more organised. Also makes him/her aware of every work and its deadline. Booking 
an appointment with the faculty makes project evaluation, doubt clarification go in a more organized manner. Students need not wait for
hours to get faculty appointment. Hence aim to solve these with our Connect PES website.
